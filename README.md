Introduction
============

Easy to use ListView with pinned sections for Android. Pinned section is a header view which sticks to the top
of the list until at least one item of that section is visible.

Watch [this video][1] to see `PinnedSectionListView` in action.

Usage
=====
 1. Replace standard `ListView` with `com.hb.views.PinnedSectionListView` in your `layout.xml` file.

        <com.hb.views.PinnedSectionListView
            android:id="@android:id/list"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
            />
  
 2. Extend your `ListAdapter` in a way that it implements `PinnedSectionListAdapter` interface, in addition to
    what it already implements. Basically you need to add a single `isItemViewTypePinned(int viewType)` 
    method. This method must return `true` for all view types which have to be pinned.

        // Our adapter class implements 'PinnedSectionListAdapter' interface
        class MyPinnedSectionListAdapter extends BaseAdapter implements PinnedSectionListAdapter {
        
             ...
           
             // We implement this method to return 'true' for all view types we want to pin
             @Override
             public boolean isItemViewTypePinned(int viewType) {
                 return viewType == <type to be pinned>;
             }
        }

That's all. You are done! A working example can also be found in `example` folder. 

Features
========
This list properly implements many features which are missing from other implementations. These are
 * Fast scroll
 * Headers and footers
 * Clickable pinned sections

Besides this it doesn't create any unnecessary views, layouts etc. It's really lean.
